# Learning rust

Just tracking my personal journey following [rust learning doc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-00-common-programming-concepts.html).

## Fun fact: I code this repo only using iPad mini

I initialized this repo, writing all the code up until this point using only iPad. And I aiming to continue to learn rust only using my iPad. My top goal is to try how far can i code in iPad, find out what are the problems in using iPad as coding tools, and maybe tackle any found problem in the future.

Well, i cheated a bit, i actually using vscode server tunnel. So I coded in vscode connecting to vscode server in a GCP Compute Instance. 

Vscode in browser run really good. but the problem is i dont have access to essential keys like ctrl, alt, ESC. So i used this ios app called VSCoW. i gave a nice esc button and others keys.
